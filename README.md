## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a built-in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service provided by GitHub. It allows you to create custom workflows that can automatically perform tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.

With GitHub Actions, you can automate various aspects of your software development workflow, saving time and effort, and ensuring that your code is always in a releasable state. GitHub Actions supports a wide range of programming languages, platforms, and integrations, making it a versatile tool for automating your software development pipelines.
